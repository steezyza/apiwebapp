# Wallet Manager

Track Your Cashflow

Wallet Manager is a web application that allows users to manage their income and expenses. They can add, remove and modify the entry list. The user's income and expense entry list is stored in the local storage, so when the page is refreshed, or the machine is rebooted, they will return with their data still intact.

This web application is developed using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

(The web application has CRUD functionality using local storage. In part two of the build I will integrate a MySQL database.)
